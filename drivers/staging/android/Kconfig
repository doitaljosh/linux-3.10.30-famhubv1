config ANDROID
	bool "Android Drivers"
	default N
	---help---
	  Enable support for various drivers needed on the Android platform

if ANDROID

config ANDROID_BINDER_IPC
	bool "Android Binder IPC Driver"
	default n
	---help---
	  Binder is used in Android for both communication between processes,
	  and remote method invocation.

	  This means one Android process can call a method/routine in another
	  Android process, using Binder to identify, invoke and pass arguments
	  between said processes.

config ASHMEM
	bool "Enable the Anonymous Shared Memory Subsystem"
	default n
	depends on SHMEM
	---help---
	  The ashmem subsystem is a new shared memory allocator, similar to
	  POSIX SHM but with different behavior and sporting a simpler
	  file-based API.

	  It is, in theory, a good memory allocator for low-memory devices,
	  because it can discard shared memory units when under memory pressure.

config ANDROID_LOGGER
	tristate "Android log driver"
	default n
	---help---
	  This adds support for system-wide logging using four log buffers.

	  These are:

	      1: main
	      2: events
	      3: radio
	      4: system

	  Log reading and writing is performed via normal Linux reads and
	  optimized writes. This optimization avoids logging having too
	  much overhead in the system.

config TIZEN_TV_DLOG_MANAGER
	bool "Managing for TIZEN TV Logging System(ANDROID_LOGGER)"
	depends on ANDROID_LOGGER
	default n
	help
	  Tizen TV use the logging system using this android logger driver.
	  The user level utility is dlog, but now this logger driver
	  have only 256K buffer, so it have some issue to disappear log
	  because of buffer full( 256K ).
	  So it need to control logs by user level process.
	  This driver will support this functionality. 

config TIZEN_TV_DLOG_DEBUG
    bool "Managing for TIZEN TV Logging System buffer(ANDROID_LOGGER)"
    depends on ANDROID_LOGGER
    default n
    help
      Tizen TV use the logging system using this android logger driver.
      The user level utility is dlog, but now this logger driver
      have only 256K buffer, so This config to change buffer size bigger for each device.

config ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER
	bool "Android Low Memory Killer"
	default N
	---help---
	  Registers processes to be killed when memory is low

config VD_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER

		Core infrastructure for VD Low Memory Killer module

config LMK_PRELOAD_APP

	  With this option enabled, LMK first kills tasks with highest
	  preload_prio value.

config ANDROID_INTF_ALARM_DEV
	bool "Android alarm driver"
	depends on RTC_CLASS
	default n
	---help---
	  Provides non-wakeup and rtc backed wakeup alarms based on rtc or
	  elapsed realtime, and a non-wakeup alarm on the monotonic clock.
	  Also exports the alarm interface to user-space.

config SYNC
	bool "Synchronization framework"
	default n
	select ANON_INODES
	help
	  This option enables the framework for synchronization between multiple
	  drivers.  Sync implementations can take advantage of hardware
	  synchronization built into devices like GPUs.

config SW_SYNC
	bool "Software synchronization objects"
	default n
	depends on SYNC
	help
	  A sync object driver that uses a 32bit counter to coordinate
	  syncrhronization.  Useful when there is no hardware primitive backing
	  the synchronization.

config SW_SYNC_USER
	bool "Userspace API for SW_SYNC"
	default n
	depends on SW_SYNC
	help
	  Provides a user space API to the sw sync object.
	  *WARNING* improper use of this can result in deadlocking kernel
	  drivers from userspace.
